         <p>This can include facts surrounding any of the defenses you have already checked off or any other facts that you think the Court should know about. This is where you should tell your story. Below are some possible ideas that could apply to you. Always be as specific as possible and attach additional pages if needed!</p>
         <li>
            <ol>You were pressured to sign the mortgage or home purchase documents.</ol>
            <ol>You were discouraged from using
               your own attorney or appraiser or other independent advisor.</ol>
               <ol>You did not receive a financial benefit from your mortgage.</ol>
               <ol>The interest rate is extremely high, or higher than you qualified for given your credit history at the time you obtained your mortgage.</ol>
               <ol>You were charged high closing costs or fees.</ol>
               <ol>Your loan application was falsified
                  (e.g. your income was misstated on your application).</ol>
                  <ol>You were told that utilities, medical expenses, or other bills would be paid off by your mortgage, but they weren’t.</ol>
                  <ol>You were told that your house was worth more than its actual value.</ol>
                  <ol>Your home was in poor condition when you purchased it and you were promised repairs that were never made.</ol>
                  <ol>You were falsely told that you could earn rental income from your home to help pay the mortgage.</ol>
                  <ol>You believe that you were targeted for an unfair or abusive mortgage loan based on your race, national origin, sex, mental or physical disability, age, alienage/ citizenship status, or other legally protected characteristic.</ol>

               OUT AND SIGN THE VERIFICATION SECTION - A Verification is a statement under oath that the Answer is truthful. After you complete the Answer, you MUST sign this verification in front of a Notary Public and have them notarize it. You can often find a Notary Public at a branch of your local bank. Please be aware they may charge you a small fee for this service.</p>

               <p class="option">STEP 7: MAKE 2 COPIES OF THE VERIFIED ANSWER</p><p>
               You will arrange for one copy to be “served” to the Plaintiff’s attorney. (See Step 8). You
               will keep the second copy for your records.</p>

               <p class="option">STEP 8: “SERVE” THE PLAINTIFF’S ATTORNEY</p><p>
               Ask someone other than yourself who is at least 18 years old and not a Defendant in the lawsuit to “serve” a copy of the Verified Answer on Plaintiff’s attorney at the address listed on the Summons and Complaint. The easiest way to “serve” the Verified Answer is to arrange for the person to send it by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by overnight delivery service. Be sure to keep the proof of mailing and delivery.</p>

               The person who “served” the copy of the Verified Answer on the Plaintiff’s attorney must fill out the Affidavit of Service in front a Notary Public and have it notarized.

(See list of the local area court clerks included in the front folder pocket of this guide.) At the County Clerk’s office, state that you wish to file an Answer. Be sure to ask the clerk to “time-stamp” the original Verified Answer, the Affidavit of Service and the copy of the Verified Answer, so that you have proof of the date and time you filed your Answer. Keep for your records a time stamped copy of the Verified Answer and a copy of the Affidavit of Service.</p>
