         <p class="option">Lack of Standing to Sue:</p>
         <p>A Foreclosure Plaintiff (the Bank) must prove that it has the right to foreclose, known as “standing”, by showing that it is the owner of the Note and Mortgage when it starts the lawsuit. You should check this box if you check off EITHER of the two boxes below related to standing. If you don’t include this claim, you may not be able to raise it later. So, if you believe that the Plaintiff may not own your Note and Mortgage, raise this defense to be safe.</p>

      <div class="panel">
      <p class="option">Plaintiff does not have standing
      to sue because it was not the legal owner of the Note and/or Mortgage at the time it commenced this foreclosure lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Check this first box if you have checked at your county clerk’s office and discovered that the Plaintiff listed on your Summons and Complaint do not match the party that is supposed to have ownership rights according to the publicly filed documents in the Clerk’s office. (Some counties are available online, while some you must visit in person.)</p>

      <p class="option">I have no knowledge that the plaintiff was assigned my debt or there was no Affirmative Allegation of Standing (NY Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law § 1302, high-cost and subprime home loans): Plaintiff failed to allege in the Foreclosure Complaint that it is the legal owner and holder of the Note and/or Mortgage or has the authority to foreclose.</p>
      <p>Check this second box if you believe that the Bank does not have standing because the Bank did not state they had standing in their Complaint.</p>

       <p>If you were not served with a copy of the Foreclosure Summons and Complaint in any of the three described ways, check off this box.</p>

         <p class="option">I did not receive the notice of default required by my mortgage agreement, and the mailing of this notice is a condition precedent to the foreclosure.</p>
         <p>For most foreclosures the Bank is required to send an Acceleration Letter (also known as a Demand Letter), which is to be sent after you have stopped paying and states that the whole amount of your mortgage is due immediately. You should use this defense if you never received an Acceleration Letter from your Bank.</p>
