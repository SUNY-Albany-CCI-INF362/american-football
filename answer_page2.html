These Pre-Foreclosure Notices must be given at least 90 days before the foreclosure Complaint is filed. You should raise this defense if you did not receive both copies of this Pre-Foreclosure Notice, or if the foreclosure lawsuit was filed before the end of 90 days after you received the Pre-Foreclosure Notices.
