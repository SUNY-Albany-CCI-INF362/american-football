            <h2> Stage 2: 90-DAY PRE-FORECLOSURE NOTICE </h2>
            <p> Under New York State law, the Bank is required to send you a notice at least 90 days before the start of a foreclosure proceeding. Typically, the Bank will send this out when you are somewhere between 30 and 60 days behind on your payments. Notices must
be sent to the last known address of the borrower by registered or certified mail, in addition to first-class mail. The letter must state the number of days you are behind
on your Mortgage, the amount of money owed and the telephone number of the
Bank. It also must provide a list of at least five government approved housing counseling agencies in your area (as seen in the folder
at the front of this guidebook). If you are reading this guide, you most likely have already received this notice.</p>
