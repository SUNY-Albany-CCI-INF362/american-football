            <h2> Stage 4: THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT </h2>
            <p> The Summons and Complaint is what tells you that a lawsuit has been started. The Summons and Complaint are created by the Bank’s attorneys, and throughout them you will be referred to as the Defendant. The Summons is usually one of the first pages, and tells you some basic information about the lawsuit that has been started. It will tell you the name of the entity that has filed the foreclosure against you. This may simply be the name of your Bank.
However, the name of the party suing you may be a long, confusing name that does not sound familiar to you. For example, you may see that the Plaintiff is “MORTGAGE SERVICING AMERICA, AS TRUSTEE FOR MORTGAGE INDEX 2005-RD4, MORTGAGE PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES SERIES 2005- RD4 UNDER THE POOLING AND SERVIING AGREEMENT DATED DECEMEBER 1, 2005.” The example of a Summons that follows this section shows an example of one of these types of trusts.
The reason this sometimes happens is that your Bank may have taken your mortgage, bundled it with hundreds of others, and
sold them on Wall Street. If that was the case, they created a “Trust” (which is a type of legal entity) that holds all the mortgages. Therefore, when a foreclosure is filed it has to be the Trust that actually is the Plaintiff.
The Complaint tells you and the Court the reasons the Bank is suing you and what they are asking the Court to do. Because this is
a foreclosure, the Bank is claiming you have not made your monthly payments as you promised in your Mortgage and Note. When
you signed your Mortgage you put your house up as collateral, in case you could not pay the amount you borrowed. Now that you have fallen behind on your payments (also known as “defaulting”), the Bank is asking the Court to enforce the terms of the Mortgage. Terms of the Mortgage typically allow the Bank to sell your house if you default on your payments to them.
When you receive the Summons and Complaint, you should also receive a notice that again informs you that help is available through a housing counseling agency. This notice will be on a different colored paper, and in larger font. It should list all the HUD- approved housing counseling agencies listed in the folder of this guidebook. If you have not contacted a housing counseling agency at this point, we once again STRONGLY urge you to contact one of them and make an appointment to talk to a counselor.
It is important to note that you may receive
a Summons and Complaint even if you have begun working with a housing counseling agency or with the Bank directly. You may
be working with the Bank’s “loss mitigation” department, which is the group that works with struggling homeowners to come up with a plan that allows you to keep your home. You may have sent in multiple rounds of documents to the Bank, and may be hopeful that a solution to your problem is just around the corner.
However, most large banks have a completely separate department that deals with filing foreclosures. Therefore, even if you are in
the process of working with the Bank, the Bank still may start a foreclosure against you. If that is the case, do not despair. You can continue to work with the Bank throughout the foreclosure proceeding. So if they have asked for more documents, or have told
you they are reviewing your file, you should continue this process!
￼￼REGARDLESS OF WHOM YOU SEE LISTED AS THE PLAINTIFF, THERE WILL NOT BE ANY REAL- WORLD DIFFERENCE IN HOW THE FORECLOSURE PROCEEDS.
Once you receive the Summons and Complaint, it is EXTREMELY important that you open ALL mail sent to you by your Bank’s attorney, and by the Court. Important notices about the status of your case will be mailed to you, and it is critical that you be aware of these developments.
You will find an example of the first pages of a Summons and a Complaint on pages 12 and 13.
STAGE 5 (OPTIONAL): FILING AN ANSWER OR NOTICE OF APPEARANCE - Once you receive the Summons and Complaint you can file
an “Answer” or a “Notice of Appearance”. If you were personally served the Summons and Complaint (typically done by a “process server”, who is a 3rd party that is hired by the Bank’s attorneys to deliver legal documents), you have 20 days to file an Answer. If the Summons and Complaint were left on your door, you should also receive a copy in the mail. If this method of delivery is used, you have 30 days to file an Answer.
An Answer is a written response to the Complaint. It does not HAVE to be filed
by you – it is optional. You typically would file an Answer only if you have legal claims against the Bank. If you simply fell behind on payments and were not able to catch up, filing an Answer is often not necessary. An Answer typically contains a paragraph-by- paragraph response to each paragraph in the Complaint.
In addition, the Answer is where you would raise any “counterclaims” against the Bank. Counterclaims are simply legal claims you have against the Bank. The Answer is where you can tell the Court any ways that you think the Bank may have violated your rights. If you have claims against the Bank and you do not file an Answer, you may be waiving your right to bring these issues up in the future.
If you wish to file an Answer, please refer to the separate section in this guidebook entitled “Filing a Pro Se Answer”, located toward the back of this guidebook.
A “Notice of Appearance” is a document filed with the Court that alerts the Court that you are an active participant in the foreclosure proceeding. By filing a Notice of Appearance, you are telling the Court that you want copies of all future legal documents related to the foreclosure to be sent to you. (If you have chosen to file an Answer, you automatically have made this request and do not need
to file a Notice of Appearance.) If you wish to file a Notice of Appearance instead of an Answer, please refer to the separate section in this guidebook entitled “Filing a Notice of Appearance”, located toward the back of this guidebook.
Regardless of whether you file anything with the Court, you still have the opportunity to participate in the Settlement Conference process.
