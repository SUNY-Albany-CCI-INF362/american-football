How to Represent Yourself in Foreclosure

Introduction

You have probably picked up this guide because you are in a foreclosure, or may be facing a foreclosure shortly. The possibility of losing your home is a very scary thought. Fighting a foreclosure through the court system can seem overwhelming to many people. This guide is not a substitute for legal assistance, and we would recommend hiring an attorney if possible. But we also understand that fewer non-profits have the resources to help people in need, the reality that attorneys can be expensive, and that finding an attorney may not be an option for you. Therefore, what we hope to do in this guide is give you a better understanding of the foreclosure process in New York State, so that you have the tools to represent yourself in the New York State Settlement Conference Process. We strongly advise you to obtain the FREE assistance of a local housing counselor. A housing counselor can assist you in communicating with your mortgagelender. Taking the first step of contacting a housing counseling agency and making an appointment will help you immensely in this foreclosure process. You will find a list of local housing counseling agencies in the folder at the front of this guidebook.

Who is this guide for?

This guide is designed for homeowners who live in a one-to-four family home, are behind on their mortgage payments, and are in or could soon face being in foreclosure. These homeowners are entitled to a “Settlement Conference” as part of the foreclosure process.


What is this guide?
This guide is designed to address the needs of homeowners facing foreclosure. This guide contains general legal information about the foreclosure and settlement conference processes. It is NOT a substitute for legal representation, and if possible you should consult an attorney. However, we understand that attorneys can be expensive. If you are not able to hire an attorney to represent you, this guide should provide you with the knowledge to represent yourself
in the foreclosure proceeding. This guide
* will give you basic information to help you understand the foreclosure timeline and
* will help you participate in the Foreclosure Settlement Conference, which may assist you in reaching an agreement with your lender.

What is a “Settlement Conference”?
Under New York State law, most homeowners in foreclosure are entitled to a “Settlement Conference”. This will occur early in the foreclosure process, and will involve the homeowner and an attorney for the bank appearing before a judge, referee or law clerk. The goal of the Settlement Conference is to attempt to come to some alternative
to foreclosure. These alternatives can range from entering a loan modification, which would allow you to keep your home and have a revised mortgage payment, to entering a “short sale” or “deed in lieu of foreclosure”, which would limit the negative consequences to your credit. Once you have entered foreclosure, the Settlement Conference is
the best chance you will have to save your home, so it is vital that you attend and have an understanding of what will happen. Much more about the Settlement Conference process will follow in this guide.

IMPORTANT FORECLOSURE PREVENTION TERMS

2You may see terms used throughout this booklet and throughout the legal documents you have received with which you are unfamiliar. What follows are definitions for several of these terms. If at any time in any of your Settlement Conferences you aren’t sure what the Bank’s attorney or court personnel are referencing, please speak up. They will be happy to explain to you what they are talking about, but unless you speak up and ask they will assume you understand everything
they have said. Do not be embarrassed to ask! There are a lot of legal terms used in a foreclosure proceeding, and even attorneys that do this work every day often times get confused. No one expects that you will understand all of this without some help.
You can also ask a housing counselor for help with these terms, as they should be familiar with them. (A list of local housing counseling agencies is included in the folder at the front of this guidebook.)

# 31% Payment: A growing trend within the mortgage industry is to have a goal of having your maximum monthly mortgage payment (including principal, interest, real estate taxes, and homeowner’s insurance) be at most 31% of your Gross Income.
# Acceleration Letter (a.k.a.: demand letter): A letter from your lender, sent after you have stopped paying, stating that the whole amount of your mortgage is due immediately.
# Answer: A written response to the Complaint, in which a homeowner lists all of their defenses to the foreclosure, as well as raises any counterclaims they may have against the Bank.
# Cancellation of Lis Pendens: A written notice that removes the previously filed Lis Pendens from the county clerk’s records, which removes questions regarding the status of title to the property.
#Capitalization: Capitalization occurs when items owed on a loan (past due interest, taxes, late charges, legal costs or other fees) are added to the unpaid principal balance of the loan and are treated as part of a new principal balance.
# Complaint: A written document that is filed with the Court and tells you and the Court the reasons the Bank is suing you and what they are asking the Court to do. Because this is a foreclosure, the Bank is claiming you have not made your monthly payments as required by your Mortgage and Note.
# Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure: A process where the borrower gives the deed to the property back to the lender, and the lender discontinues any foreclosure action.
# Default: Failing to meet the requirements of an agreement. Most defaults involve failing to make required mortgage payments on time.
# Deficiency: The amount a borrower owes to the lender after the sale of the property at a foreclosure sale in the event the property is sold for less than the amount of the debt owed.
# Discovery: A tool used in lawsuits to obtain information and documents from other parties.
# Forbearance: A plan to cure a default that may involve a temporary suspension or reduction of payments.
# Interest Rate: The amount charged by a lender for the right to borrow money, as expressed as a percentage of the principal amount borrowed.
# Judgment: The final part of a court case. A valid judgment resolves all the contested issues and terminates the lawsuit, since it is regarded as the court’s official pronouncement of the law on the action that was pending before it. It states who wins the case and what remedies the winner is awarded.
# Lis Pendens: A written notice that a lawsuit has been filed concerning real estate, involving either the title to the property or a claimed ownership interest in it. The notice is usually filed in the county clerk’s office. Recording a Lis Pendens alerts a potential purchaser or lender that the property’s title is in question, which makes the property less attractive to a buyer or lender.
# Loan Modification: An agreement to permanently change one or more terms of the original mortgage (i.e.: interest rate, payment amount, term etc.)
# Loss Mitigation: The process in which the Bank will work with homeowners in an effort to avoid foreclosure. This term often refers to the group within the Bank that you will be working with throughout the foreclosure process.
# Mortgage: A written document that secures property as collateral for a loan. This is the document that allows the bank to foreclose, because you have agreed that if you default on the Note (i.e.: stop payments) they can sell your property to collect on the debt.
# Note: A written document that is a promise to pay. Typically, when you borrow a large sum of money from a lender, you pay it back with interest, in monthly installments, over a period of years. All these loan terms are found in the loan’s note.
# Notice of Appearance: Formal notification by a party to a court (and to parties already involved in a case) that it wishes to participate in the litigation process.
# Order of Reference: A document presented by the Bank to the Court, which allows the foreclosure proceeding to continue in the Court system if a Settlement Conference has been unsuccessful. An Order of Reference would appoint a Referee to determine how much you owe the Bank.
# Principal Reduction: A reduction in the total amount owed on the loan.
# Pro Se: Appearing in a court proceeding for oneself - without an attorney representing them.
# Process Server: A person authorized by law to deliver papers, typically the Summons and Complaint, to the Defendant.
# Refinancing: The process of paying off a loan by borrowing new money, either from the existing lender or a new lender.
# Repayment Plan: A plan where the borrower pays their regular monthly mortgage payment PLUS an additional amount to pay off the amount they are behind on their mortgage.
# Service: The delivery of a summons, complaint, or other legal document to a person.
# Short Sale: The sale of a home for less than what is owed on the mortgage. Short sales must be approved by the lender, since the Bank will take a loss on what is owed to them.
# Stipulation of Discontinuance: A document filed by the Bank with the Court to signify that an agreement has been reached and that the foreclosure proceeding will be terminated.
# Summary Judgment: A motion in a court proceeding to end the case without a trial on all the facts. This is typically done in the foreclosure context before any Discovery has occurred.
# Summons: A legal document that notifies a party that a legal proceeding has been started.

What is a foreclosure?

In New York, a foreclosure is a legal action - a lawsuit - filed by a lender (who is called the Plaintiff, but we will call the “Bank” throughout this guide) against a borrower (who is called the Defendant). This usually happens when a borrower has stopped making payments on their mortgage (otherwise known as “defaulting” on the mortgage or becoming delinquent). The Bank is asking the Court to allow them to take full ownership of your house. Typically the Bank would then attempt to sell your home at a public auction to recover the money still owed under your Mortgage and Note. The Bank files a Summons and Complaint with the Supreme Court in the county where the home is located. (In New York State, the Supreme Court is actually the lowest level of the state court system.) The Bank then gives (or “serves”) you with copies of the Summons and Complaint.
A foreclosure proceeding is a long process with many steps, and usually takes no less than six months from start to finish. What follows is a brief summary of the steps in a foreclosure. After the brief summary, we will then go into greater detail on each stage.


THE FORECLOSURE PROCESS IN GENERAL

STAGE 1: HOMEOWNER FALLS BEHIND ON PAYMENTS - This can happen for any number of reasons, but the end result is the same: your financial situation is such that
you have not been able to keep current on your Mortgage. Each Mortgage has specific language about when the Bank may begin
a foreclosure proceeding. For instance, we often see mortgages that say if a homeowner falls more than 3 months behind on payments, the Bank can begin foreclosure proceedings.

STAGE 2: 90-DAY PRE-FORECLOSURE NOTICE
Under New York State law, the Bank is required to send you a notice at least 90 days before the start of a foreclosure proceeding. Typically, the Bank will send this out when you are somewhere between 30 and 60 days behind on your payments. Notices must
be sent to the last known address of the borrower by registered or certified mail, in addition to first-class mail. The letter must state the number of days you are behind
on your Mortgage, the amount of money owed and the telephone number of the
Bank. It also must provide a list of at least five government approved housing counseling agencies in your area (as seen in the folder
at the front of this guidebook). If you are reading this guide, you most likely have already received this notice.

STAGE 3: THE DEMAND LETTER (OR THE “ACCELERATION LETTER”) - This is a letter sent by the Bank to the Borrower before
a foreclosure proceeding is filed in Court, pointing out that the terms of the Mortgage have been violated due to nonpayment. You will typically be given 30 days to pay the delinquent amount and any associated late fees.

STAGE 4: THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT -
These documents will be the first notice you will receive that a foreclosure case has been started with the court.

STAGE 5 (OPTIONAL): FILING AN ANSWER -
This is a written statement you may choose to prepare in response to the Summons and Complaint. Typically, an Answer is only done when you feel you have legal claims against the Bank.

STAGE 6: SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE - This
is an opportunity for you to sit down with the Bank at your local courthouse to try to work out an alternative to foreclosure so that you may keep your home. You will find out about the time and date of the Settlement Conference in a letter sent to you by the Court.

STAGE 7A: SUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE - It is possible that you and the Bank will work out an arrangement allowing you to keep your home. If this happens, the Bank will file a document called a “Cancellation of Lis Pendens” that will end the foreclosure proceeding in the court system.

STAGE 7B: UNSUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE – If you and the Bank cannot agree on an alternative to foreclosure, the foreclosure will be allowed to move forward in the court system. An “Order of Reference” will likely be granted to the Bank. This allows the Bank to obtain a “Judgment”, which will then allow them to take ownership of the house after an auction.

STAGE 8: (IF SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE WAS UNSUCCESSFUL) POST-JUDGMENT - These
are the events that occur after Judgment has been entered. Unless a last-minute deal with the Bank is reached, this stage will end with the house being sold at a public auction to the highest bidder and you will have to move out of your house.

Foreclosure Process In Detail

STAGE 1: HOMEOWNER FALLS BEHIND IN PAYMENTS - It may be a loss of a job, or a
cut in your pay rate. Perhaps you have just gone through a divorce, or had a major medical concern. Whatever the reason is, you have fallen behind on your mortgage payments. When this happens, often times homeowners are put in the no-win situation of paying all their other bills, or paying their mortgage. There is really no “right” answer to this question, because whichever bill doesn’t get paid has the possibility of leading to negative consequences. If it is the Mortgage that doesn’t get paid, the Bank will begin contacting you to find out when you will make your missed payments. Homeowners often will ignore these calls, because they know they cannot make the payment in the foreseeable future. Perhaps you are able to make some payments, so you are always a month or two behind. Eventually, you fall behind to the point that the Bank is ready to threaten you with foreclosure.

STAGE 2 : THE 90-DAY PRE-FORECLOSURE NOTICE - The timing of when you will receive a 90-Day Pre-Foreclosure Notice varies from case to case, but typically if you fall 30 or more days behind you will likely receive
this letter. Under New York State law, this letter is required to be sent to you. The Bank must wait at least 90 days from sending this letter before they begin a foreclosure action against you. This 90-day window gives you the opportunity to try to work with the Bank to find an alternative to foreclosure. This notice must tell you how much you must
pay to bring your loan current. It must also provide the names and telephone numbers of at least 5 not-for-profit housing counseling agencies serving your county. (You will find a list of local housing counseling agencies
for your area in the folder in the front of this guidebook.)
If you are reading this guide, you most likely have already received this notice. If you have
recently received this letter, we strongly urge you to do one of two things: (1) Contact a local housing counseling agency and make an appointment to meet with them, as they can help you through the process of working with the Bank without any cost to you; or
(2) If you choose not to utilize the services of a housing counseling agency, contact your Bank directly. The longer you wait to work with your Bank, the harder it will be for you to keep your home!
Page 8 shows an example of what a 90-Day Pre-Foreclosure Notice looks like.

STAGE 3: THE DEMAND LETTER
The timing of when you will receive a “Demand Letter” depends on the language in your Mortgage, but typically this will occur when you are 45 to 60 days behind on payments. Although the Bank is threatening to begin a foreclosure proceeding if you
do not pay and may even say that you are
in foreclosure when you contact them, at this point they have not actually filed any documents with the Court.
It is important to note that you may receive a Demand Letter, even if you have contacted the Bank and have begun to work with them in trying to work out a plan to get current. You may have sent lots of documents to
the Bank, which they are actively reviewing. Regardless of these efforts, you still may receive a Demand Letter. With many large banks, the Demand Letter is automatically generated when you fall behind by a certain amount of time on payments. Therefore, even if you are being reviewed for workout solutions, you still will receive the Demand Letter. It does not mean that the Bank
has stopped reviewing your documents. Therefore, if the Bank has asked you for more documents, send them in – do not assume that process has ended.


STAGE 4: SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT -
The Summons and Complaint is what tells you that a lawsuit has been started. The Summons and Complaint are created by the Bank’s attorneys, and throughout them you will be referred to as the Defendant. The Summons is usually one of the first pages, and tells you some basic information about the lawsuit that has been started. It will tell you the name of the entity that has filed the foreclosure against you. This may simply be the name of your Bank.
However, the name of the party suing you may be a long, confusing name that does not sound familiar to you. For example, you may see that the Plaintiff is “MORTGAGE SERVICING AMERICA, AS TRUSTEE FOR MORTGAGE INDEX 2005-RD4, MORTGAGE PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES SERIES 2005- RD4 UNDER THE POOLING AND SERVIING AGREEMENT DATED DECEMEBER 1, 2005.” The example of a Summons that follows this section shows an example of one of these types of trusts.
The reason this sometimes happens is that your Bank may have taken your mortgage, bundled it with hundreds of others, and
sold them on Wall Street. If that was the case, they created a “Trust” (which is a type of legal entity) that holds all the mortgages. Therefore, when a foreclosure is filed it has to be the Trust that actually is the Plaintiff.
The Complaint tells you and the Court the reasons the Bank is suing you and what they are asking the Court to do. Because this is
a foreclosure, the Bank is claiming you have not made your monthly payments as you promised in your Mortgage and Note. When
you signed your Mortgage you put your house up as collateral, in case you could not pay the amount you borrowed. Now that you have fallen behind on your payments (also known as “defaulting”), the Bank is asking the Court to enforce the terms of the Mortgage. Terms of the Mortgage typically allow the Bank to sell your house if you default on your payments to them.
When you receive the Summons and Complaint, you should also receive a notice that again informs you that help is available through a housing counseling agency. This notice will be on a different colored paper, and in larger font. It should list all the HUD- approved housing counseling agencies listed in the folder of this guidebook. If you have not contacted a housing counseling agency at this point, we once again STRONGLY urge you to contact one of them and make an appointment to talk to a counselor.
It is important to note that you may receive
a Summons and Complaint even if you have begun working with a housing counseling agency or with the Bank directly. You may
be working with the Bank’s “loss mitigation” department, which is the group that works with struggling homeowners to come up with a plan that allows you to keep your home. You may have sent in multiple rounds of documents to the Bank, and may be hopeful that a solution to your problem is just around the corner.
However, most large banks have a completely separate department that deals with filing foreclosures. Therefore, even if you are in
the process of working with the Bank, the Bank still may start a foreclosure against you. If that is the case, do not despair. You can continue to work with the Bank throughout the foreclosure proceeding. So if they have asked for more documents, or have told
you they are reviewing your file, you should continue this process!
￼￼REGARDLESS OF WHOM YOU SEE LISTED AS THE PLAINTIFF, THERE WILL NOT BE ANY REAL- WORLD DIFFERENCE IN HOW THE FORECLOSURE PROCEEDS.
Once you receive the Summons and Complaint, it is EXTREMELY important that you open ALL mail sent to you by your Bank’s attorney, and by the Court. Important notices about the status of your case will be mailed to you, and it is critical that you be aware of these developments.
You will find an example of the first pages of a Summons and a Complaint on pages 12 and 13.
STAGE 5 (OPTIONAL): FILING AN ANSWER OR NOTICE OF APPEARANCE - Once you receive the Summons and Complaint you can file
an “Answer” or a “Notice of Appearance”. If you were personally served the Summons and Complaint (typically done by a “process server”, who is a 3rd party that is hired by the Bank’s attorneys to deliver legal documents), you have 20 days to file an Answer. If the Summons and Complaint were left on your door, you should also receive a copy in the mail. If this method of delivery is used, you have 30 days to file an Answer.
An Answer is a written response to the Complaint. It does not HAVE to be filed
by you – it is optional. You typically would file an Answer only if you have legal claims against the Bank. If you simply fell behind on payments and were not able to catch up, filing an Answer is often not necessary. An Answer typically contains a paragraph-by- paragraph response to each paragraph in the Complaint.
In addition, the Answer is where you would raise any “counterclaims” against the Bank. Counterclaims are simply legal claims you have against the Bank. The Answer is where you can tell the Court any ways that you think the Bank may have violated your rights. If you have claims against the Bank and you do not file an Answer, you may be waiving your right to bring these issues up in the future.
If you wish to file an Answer, please refer to the separate section in this guidebook entitled “Filing a Pro Se Answer”, located toward the back of this guidebook.
A “Notice of Appearance” is a document filed with the Court that alerts the Court that you are an active participant in the foreclosure proceeding. By filing a Notice of Appearance, you are telling the Court that you want copies of all future legal documents related to the foreclosure to be sent to you. (If you have chosen to file an Answer, you automatically have made this request and do not need
to file a Notice of Appearance.) If you wish to file a Notice of Appearance instead of an Answer, please refer to the separate section in this guidebook entitled “Filing a Notice of Appearance”, located toward the back of this guidebook.
Regardless of whether you file anything with the Court, you still have the opportunity to participate in the Settlement Conference process.


STAGE 6 : THE SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE -
At this point in the process, you have now been made aware through the Summons
and Complaint that the Bank has started a foreclosure in the Court system. You may have filed an Answer or Notice of Appearance, or you may have decided to skip that optional step. Either way, the next step in the process will be the scheduling of a “Settlement Conference”.
Under New York State law, a Settlement Conference must be held if you are living
in your 1-to-4 unit home. The idea behind the Settlement Conference is to protect the homeowner. By now, many homeowners will have already contacted the Bank to work out a solution. However, banks can be incredibly difficult to work with. Homeowners send the same documents to the Bank many times, only to have the Bank tell them they never received them, or that still more documents are needed. Sometimes, the Bank will take
a long time to review your documents, and then tell you that the documents are out of date and therefore you need to send updated documents again.
The idea behind the Settlement Conference is to give the homeowner an opportunity
to work with the Bank to come to some alternative to foreclosure, with the Court’s help. The general idea is that until the Bank proves to the Court that they have attempted to find an alternative to foreclosure, the Court will not allow the foreclosure to move forward in the Court system. In this way, the Settlement Conference can be thought of
as a “safety zone” for homeowners – while you are in the Settlement Conference phase of the foreclosure process, the foreclosure essentially is “frozen” in the Court system. Therefore, you do not have to worry about showing up at your house to find the locks changed, or a notice saying you must be out of your house in days, or any of the other horror stories you may have read about from other parts of the country.
You should receive a letter in the mail from the Court with the time, date and place of the Settlement Conference. The notice of your Settlement Conference typically comes a few weeks after the Summons and Complaint. The notice will also list the documents you should bring with you to the Settlement Conference.
If you do not show up at your first scheduled Settlement Conference without contacting the Court, the Court may declare this stage of the foreclosure to be over, and allow the foreclosure to move forward. This is your best opportunity to work with the Bank and attempt to save your home, but it only can work if you take an active part in the process.
If for some reason you cannot attend the scheduled Settlement Conference, you will need to contact the Court to reschedule. Contact information can be found in the
front folder pocket of this guidebook. You should do this as soon as you realize there is a conflict. If you have received a Summons and Complaint, but have not received the notice for a Settlement Conference yet, you should call the Court and ask if one is scheduled. Page 15 shows an example of the letter you will receive from the Court regarding the scheduling of your Settlement Conference.
IT IS VITAL THAT YOU ATTEND THE FIRST SCHEDULED SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE!
￼￼￼

Who attends a Settlement Conference?
The homeowner can appear at a Settlement Conference with or without an attorney. (Appearing without an attorney is referred to as appearing “pro se”.) The Bank must have a representative available at the Settlement Conference. Typically, this will be the Bank’s attorney.

What should you expect at a Settlement Conference?
The Settlement Conference is your opportunity to work with the Bank and try to find an alternative to foreclosure. You will describe your situation; the Court may ask questions about your finances, your income and your debts. The Court may also ask whether you have any savings set aside. The Bank should be able to describe how much you owe and how this amount was calculated. There will be no witnesses or testimony, it is simply an opportunity for both sides to ask questions and explore solutions. Again, it is very important that you attend each and every Settlement Conference that is scheduled.

What are your rights at a Settlement Conference?
At the Settlement Conference, you have the right to:
• Have a friend, family member, attorney
or advocate assist you;
• Have anything explained to you;
• Ask for an adjournment (a rescheduling)
of the conference if you cannot attend
for a valid reason
• Ask for copies of:
- Your Note
- Your Mortgage
- A payment history (so you can review
what payments have been applied and
when)
- An explanation of any fees or charges
to your loan

What should you do to prepare for your settlement conference?

STEP 1: CONTACT A HUD-APPROVED HOUSING COUNSELING AGENCY - Located in the front folder of this guidebook is a list of your local HUD-approved housing counseling agencies. If other companies or individuals tell you that they can help save your home
if you pay them money, you should be suspicious – often times these are scammers who are trying to make a quick dollar at your expense. High quality and expert services are available for free from the agencies listed in this guide, and we recommend you contact one of them if you are looking for help. The Bank will likely give the homeowner a packet of forms that must be filled out and returned to the Bank, so that the Bank can review your loan for a possible “loan modification.” The forms the Bank asks you to fill out are designed to give the Bank a snapshot of your current financial situation. Therefore, they will ask about both your income and your monthly expenses. Some of the forms will be specific to your Bank, while others will be forms used by all banks as required by federal law. In addition, most banks will ask for your most recent bank statements and a copy of your income taxes. Again, this is used to have a better understanding of your financial situation.
It is very rare that you will be able to come to an agreement with the Bank at the first Settlement Conference. What typically happens is that the Court will schedule another Settlement Conference for you.

STEP 2: GATHER ALL YOUR DOCUMENTS - You are required to bring some documents with you to the Settlement Conference. There are other documents the Bank will require to review your loan. If you have already submitted these documents (often called a “loss mitigation” or “workout” package),
you should expect to submit them again. You should also gather all the documents you received when you originally got the loan (referred to as the “loan documents” or “closing documents”) if you can locate them. A list of documents to gather is included below.

	Documents to Gather
￼￼￼￼The last two months of pay stubs for everyone who regularly helps pay the mortgage
￼￼￼￼If you receive rental income:
	Copies of your current lease AND Schedule E in tax returns AND/OR
	Bank statements showing regular rental deposits AND/OR
	Copies of rent receipts you give to your tenants AND/OR
	Section 8 or other subsidy agreements
￼￼￼￼Tax returns for the last two years
￼￼￼￼If you receive money from the state (social security, disability payments, VA benefits etc) or a pension:
	Most recent award letter AND
	3 months worth of bank statements showing deposits of this money OR 3 months worth of payment stubs
￼￼￼￼If you are self-employed you should have a profit and loss statement available for the last two quarters
￼￼￼￼If other people in your household are contributing to the household bills, copies of their paystubs/income documents
￼￼￼ Your most recent utility bill that is listed in your name
￼￼￼￼Financial Form provided by the Bank
￼￼￼￼Hardship letter
	(This is a letter you write that explains why you fell behind. You should indicate in the letter if this was a temporary setback, or if this is a permanent change in your household income.)
￼￼￼￼Your most recent mortgage statement
￼￼￼￼Forbearance, loan modification, or workout offers you have received, regardless of whether you accepted or rejected them
￼￼ ￼All papers and letters you have received from the Court, the Bank, and the Bank’s attorney
￼￼￼ Copies of your loan application (or the Uniform Residential Loan Application)
￼￼￼￼Your HUD-1 Settlement Statement
￼￼￼￼The Note and any riders (Balloon Rider or Adjustable Rate Rider)
￼￼￼ Mortgage and riders
￼￼￼￼Truth-in-Lending Disclosure Statement
￼￼￼￼Good Faith Estimate
￼￼￼ Your Deed
￼￼￼￼Most recent appraisal (if you have one)
￼￼￼￼Any other papers related to fees you paid at closing, either to your lender or your broker or anyone else

If you cannot find all these documents, you should still GO TO THE SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE. If there are documents the Bank provided to you when you initially got your loan (like the Note or the Mortgage) and you don’t have a copy, you can request a copy of them at the Settlement Conference.

STEP 3: COMPLETE YOUR BUDGET - Read through this entire section before filling out your budget. The budget in this guide is only for your use. No one else is going to see it unless you show it to them. It is designed to help you make an honest assessment if you can afford to keep your home. This is also good preparation for meeting with your housing counselor and filling out your Bank’s financial forms.

MONTHLY INCOME
First, you need to compute your total monthly income. Listed below are the most common sources of income. You want to list all of your personal sources of income (Column A), as well as any other income from anyone else in your house if they are helping contribute to the mortgage (Column B).
Please remember that you MUST be able to verify all the sources of income you use in the budget. Your Bank will not consider sources of income without accompanying verification. If you are using another household member’s income in your budget, count that person’s expenses as well and make sure you have verification of their income.
Gross Household Income: Adding
columns A and B gives you your “Total Gross Household Income.” This amount is $_______. Multiply this number by .31. This equals $_________, and we will refer to this as your “31% Payment”. Most of the large banks in the country have recently settled on 31% as being one of the main standards they use
in determining if a payment is affordable – anything above 31% is often looked at as being too high. Therefore, your 31% Payment is an approximate amount you should
￼￼￼￼￼Gross Household Income
￼￼￼Net Household Income
￼￼￼￼￼Your Income BEFORE Taxes
(A)
Other Income in Your Home BEFORE Taxes (B)
￼￼Your Income AFTER taxes (Net Income) (C)
￼Other Income in your home AFTER taxes (D)
￼Regular Wages
￼￼￼￼￼￼Part Time Work
￼￼￼￼￼￼Rental Income
￼￼￼￼￼￼Public Assistance
￼￼￼￼￼￼Unemployment
￼￼￼￼￼￼Disability
￼￼￼￼￼￼Social Security
￼￼￼￼￼￼Pension
￼￼￼￼￼￼Alimony
￼￼￼￼￼￼Other
￼￼￼￼￼￼Sub-Total
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼TOTAL INCOME
￼TOTAL GROSS INCOME (Add columns A and B) $__________________
￼TOTAL NET INCOME (Add columns C and D) $________________
￼￼￼
expect to pay in total for your first mortgage, homeowners insurance, property taxes and condo fees/homeowners association fees.
Remember, there is no law that says you cannot pay more than 31% -- this is merely meant as a guide to give you a better idea of what many of the national banks have recently done. In addition, if you were paying less than this before you defaulted, be prepared for your mortgage payment to increase to this amount each month.
Net Household Income: Adding columns C and D gives you your “Total Household Net Income.” This amount is $_______. This is how much you actually receive each month, and the amount available to pay your bills.

MONTHLY EXPENSES
Now that we have looked at your income, we need to compute your total monthly expenses. Included on the next page (page 20) is a list of typical household expenses you may have each month. Fill in each category as best you can. We realize that it often can be difficult to estimate certain categories, such as how much you spend on food each month. However, it is vital for you to fill this out as accurately as possible. The only way to make an accurate determination if you can afford your home is to look at what else you are spending your money on. You will likely have to fill out a very similar form for your Bank, so working on your budget now will help you.

￼￼Next you need to calculate how much money you have after you pay all your bills, or how much more you are spending each month than you are earning. Take your Total Net Income, which you calculated earlier, and subtract your Total Monthly Expenses, which you just calculated.
If this amount is negative, it is referred to
as your “monthly deficit”. If this amount is positive, it is referred to as your “monthly surplus”. If you have a monthly deficit, do
you see any sources of income that you can increase, or any expenses you may be able
to cut back on? In addition, look at the 31% Payment we calculated earlier. If we plugged the 31% Payment amount into your budget
in place of the current Monthly Mortgage Payment, would that be enough to turn your monthly deficit into a monthly surplus? If not, you may not be able to afford your home and you should seriously consider other options (such as a “short sale” or a “deed-in-lieu of foreclosure”).
￼￼￼￼Total Net Income $___________
￼Total Monthly Expenses - $___________
￼MONTHLY SURPLUS/DEFICIT = $___________

STEP 4: TELL YOUR STORY - The reasons you ended up in foreclosure are probably long and complicated, and each borrower’s situation is slightly different. The Settlement Conference is a chance for you to share your story with the Court and the Bank.
By preparing to tell your story before the Settlement Conference, it is more likely you will tell your story in a way that everyone can understand. They need to know why you are in foreclosure, and what you have done to resolve your situation. The clearer you are to the Court and the Bank, the easier it will be to resolve the foreclosure. You should write out answers to the following questions:

What are the reasons for falling behind on your mortgage? _______________________ ______________________________________
What have you done to try to keep your home? _______________________________ ______________________________________
Were there any terms of your loan that were different than what you were promised? ____________________________ ______________________________________
You should also be able to talk about basic information about your loan, such as the following:
The current monthly payments are $_____. The current interest rate is: ______% and my interest rate (circle one) changes/does not change. I last made a payment on my loan in _______________ (list month and year).
Have you attempted to work with your Bank to find a solution already? If so, make a list below of all the people you have contacted, and the times you have sent in documents before the Settlement Conference.


STEP 5: ATTEND THE SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE AND WORK TOWARDS A LOAN MODIFICATION

WORKING TOWARD A LOAN MODIFICATION
If your loan can be modified there are several ways your Bank will likely go about it. The Bank may do any of the following:
- Lower your interest rate
- Convert an Adjustable Rate Mortgage to
a Fixed Rate Mortgage
- Extend the term of the loan
- Forgive a portion of your principal
balance
Regardless of which way the Bank considers, they typically will modify a loan by doing a “capitalization”. Capitalization occurs when items owed on a loan (e.g. past due interest, taxes, late charges, legal costs, etc.) are added to the unpaid principal balance of the loan and are treated as part of a new principal balance. In adding them to the unpaid principal balance, the Bank will cause the overall amount that is owed to the Bank on that loan to increase. The upside
to a capitalization is that because all current outstanding charges have been rolled into the unpaid principal balance, the Borrower is now seen as current on their mortgage payments. By doing a capitalization, the homeowner does not have to make up all missed payments at one time.
Any agreement you reach should clearly state how much you owe, what your interest rate will be going forward, what each charge is for, what your monthly payment will be, how long you will be making that payment, and what will happen if either side violates the agreement. Ask for a written explanation of any and all charges that are part of this loan modification, and ask that attorney’s fees and late fees be reduced or waived.

STAGE 7A: SUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE - If you have successfully worked out a deal with the Bank in the Settlement Conference, the foreclosure proceeding will be discontinued. The Bank should file a “Stipulation of Discontinuance”, which is a document that tells the Court that
the Bank is no longer pursuing a foreclosure. In addition, the Bank will file a “Cancellation of the Lis Pendens”, which ensures that the land records with the local County Clerk accurately reflect that the foreclosure proceeding is over.

STAGE 7B: UNSUCCESSFUL SETTLEMENT CONFERENCE - If you are unable to work
out a deal with the Bank at the Settlement Conference, the Bank will ask for an “Order
of Reference”, which is the next step in the foreclosure proceeding. The Bank will file either a “Summary Judgment Motion” (if you filed an Answer) or a “Default Motion” (if you did not file an Answer). Both these motions allow the foreclosure to go forward against you, and a Referee will be appointed to compute the amount due and owing under the note and mortgage. Once the Referee is done computing the amount owed, the Bank will move for a Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale, which allows them to sell the property.

STAGE 8: POST JUDGMENT - Once a Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale has been signed, a sale date is set and the property is sold at public auction. After the auction to sell the property, you will not have too much time to find a new place to live. If you do not move out on your own, you will be served with eviction papers.

It bears repeating that there is help available. You may speak with a HUD-approved housing counselor by contacting any of the agencies listed in the front folder pocket of this guidebook. If you are going to represent yourself in the Settlement Conference process, by preparing ahead of time, gathering all your documents and attending all the Settlement Conferences, you are in a much better place to successfully keep your home. Although the Settlement Conference can be long and challenging, it has allowed many New Yorkers to keep their homes.
